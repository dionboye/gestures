#CIS 192 Final Project Proposal

##Team Members
Jocelin Lee (jocelin), Gaby MorenoCesar (gmoren), Kevin Shen (kshen)

##Description
Our team is interested in using image processing for our final project. We will be working on a native OSX application for gesture scrolling, or as we like to think of it lazy reading. A user will open the app, hide it, and use vertical hand movements to scroll through their current window as well as horizontal movements to switch Mac workspaces.

The components of the project involve image processing, key bindings, and calibration. We will need to recognize both shape and movement of the hand using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) as well as the PyObjC library to build the Cocoa app.

##Expected Work Breakdown (man hours)
*  Recognizing hand position - 6 hours
* Recognizing hand movement - 6 hours
* Programmatically pressing keys and moving mouse ~ 6 hours
* Mapping hand gesture to keypress - 10 hours
* Calibration - 10 hours
* Implementing more hand gesture > keypress or mouse movements - 20 hours
